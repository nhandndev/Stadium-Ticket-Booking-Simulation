[Data setup](../00_SETUP.md) · [Complete demo order](../01_DEMO_ORDER.md) · [Feature index](../README.md)

## Demo prerequisites

- Use CORE_DIR, COUNTER_DEMO_DIR or EXPIRY_DEMO_DIR as specified for each flow. The setup guide creates these copies. Follow the order so IDs and state match.
- Earlier venue, seat, Match, purchase and refund flows prepare records reused by later flows.
- Open a feature file for reference. Flow numbers preserve the global execution order.
